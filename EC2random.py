# Create an EC2 random name generator using random python library

# Allow the user to input how many EC2 instances they want names for and output the same amount of unique names.

# Allow the user to input the name of their department that is used in the unique name.

# Generate random characters and numbers that will be included in the unique name.

# The only departments that should use this Name Generator are the Marketing, Accounting, and FinOps Departments. List these departments as options and if a user puts another department, print a message that they should not use this Name Generator. Be sure to account for incorrect upper or lowercase letters in the correct department. Example: a user inputs accounting vs Accounting.
